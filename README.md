# Vue Transition Builder

> An interactive tool to build and visualize Vue.js transitions with Animate.css. Quickly select enter/leave animations, speed, and delay, then generate the code for your projects.

This was quickly vibe coded to help me in my own personal projects, so it's simple and straight to the point.
